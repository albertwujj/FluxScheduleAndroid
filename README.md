# FluxScheduleAndroid
Android prototype of my Flux Schedule app, at WSU hackathon

See Flux Schedule on iOS for released version. Basically a paper schedule but everything is editable, and you can drag to reorder entries (times are auto-adjusting). Also, no multiple pages like all other scheduling apps.
No better scheduler if you plan out your whole day/you used to use paper schedules.
